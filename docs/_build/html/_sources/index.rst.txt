Welcome to FLAMES documentation!
==================================

The FLAMES is a general purpose adsorption simulation toolbox built around the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE),
which provides tools for molecular simulations and adsorption studies using machine learning potentials, classical force fields,
and other advanced techniques.

Here you will find tutorials and examples on how to install and use FLAMES to run different adsorption simulations on porous
structures. These are aimed for new users and people with more experience on molecular modeling.


First steps
-----------

Some very basic information. If you are not familiar with Python or molecular simulations, 
maybe it is best to start here, otherwise you can just skip and go to the next sections.
